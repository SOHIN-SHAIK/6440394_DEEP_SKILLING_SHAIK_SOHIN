### ✨ Why This Matters
> **“Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of intelligent effort.”** — *John Ruskin*

With the successful completion of **ALL mandatory and additional exercises** for *Week 1*, I have laid a strong foundation in both **design excellence** and **algorithmic thinking** — key skills for a Java Full Stack Engineer 🚀.

Building on that, *Week 2* deepened my expertise in database programming, unit testing, mocking, and enterprise-level debugging — enabling me to write robust, test-driven, and maintainable backend code with confidence.

 Completed Week 3 with hands-on Spring Boot & JPA, mastering RESTful CRUD APIs, MySQL integration, and layered architecture using controllers, services, and repositories ⚙️.

On Top of it, Week 4 elevated my backend skills through Spring Core (XML config), multiple REST microservices, and secure JWT-based authentication 🔐.

To Roof it, It is lead with Week 5 accomplishments as I Built account and loan microservices with Spring Boot REST APIs, inter-service communication, and robust validation, simulating real-world banking systems.

Developed and integrated a responsive React frontend with Spring Boot microservices for a complete full-stack banking application.
